        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I have a diverse background in IT systems support, education, and virtual assistance. With experience teaching ICT to young learners and supporting businesses through technical troubleshooting and administrative services, I’ve developed strong skills in problem-solving, communication, and digital productivity. I’m also trained in front-end development and have a growing interest in web technologies that enhance user experience and accessibility.</p>
        <p>Outside of work, I enjoy exploring creative outlets like photography, videography, and live streaming. I have a passion for cultural expression and serve as a dance and cultural instructor, sharing traditions through performance and education. I believe in using my talents not only to grow professionally but also to uplift others and support the less privileged in reaching their full potential.</p>
